We booked trek Valley Flowers Trekmunk 20/08/2018 25/08/2018 looking good reviews. It supposed personal tour wife made full payment 1 month advance. But despite repeated requests send us booking confirmations, Mohit kept delaying asking us worry. Then suddenly day trip, Mohit called say I arrange transportation Haridwar Govindghat made arrangements although itinerary clearly mentioned pickup drop Haridwar. After several phone calls fro Mohit Oshank, finally agreed "try arrange" shared taxi us (This despite tour booked private tour 2 people).Oshank simply said take shared cab, pay transport.  But failed arrange even that. While lucky shared taxi journey Haridwar Joshimath, return leg simply said cabs available either find cab take bus. Eventually I forced catch state transport bus 5am Joshimath. I walk alone wife bus stand 4am morning carrying luggage unknown area. The thing Trekmunk offer us bus fare. When contacted Mohit saying least booked shared cab us rather leaving us arrangements, simply said sorry. His unprofessional careless attitude almost ruined trip.If plan book Trekmunk, please confirm everything beforehand ask booking confirmations everything well trip. DON'T FALL INTO THEIR TRAP WHEN THEY SAY THAT ALL BOOKINGS ARE DONE. Ask mail confirmations want get stranded road. While talk friendly seem quite good phone, highly careless unprofessional towards clients.
We booked Stok Kangri trek Trekmunk batch 18th 25th Aug 2018. The communication Trekmunk's team robust responded promptly queries trek.During trek base camp, crew took good care us. The food awesome chef ensured us well-fed. The instructions itinerary safety clear trek leaders - Salman, Sonam Lappu.The summit day extremely challenging. Unfortunately, despite extreme efforts guides boost motivation, I give certain point. Salman decided come made sure I returned safely base camp.Overall, I would say well coordinated. I would definitely go another trek Trekmunk would also recommend friends go them.

Talked less more.3)  Trek guides Lappu & Sonam professional. Lappu       thrilling options  like rock climbing, rafting etc offered us low       price reference  Harshit & Oshank .    overall well coordinated, well planned, well managed excellent Trek     arranged Trekmunk..
